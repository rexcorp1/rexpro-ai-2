This is a playground to interact with Gemini models, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Create an environment file:**
    -   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.
    -   Open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key:
        ```
        VITE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
-   `npm run lint`: Lints the code.
-   `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.
